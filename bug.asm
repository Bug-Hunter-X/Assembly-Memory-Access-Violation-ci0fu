mov eax, [ebx+esi*4] ;This line is the source of the error. It attempts to read from memory using the address calculated by ebx+esi*4, which could lead to memory access violations if ebx+esi*4 points outside the allocated memory.  This is a common problem when using array indexing in assembly.  Another potential issue is the lack of bounds checking. There's nothing to ensure that esi is within a valid range for the array being accessed.
