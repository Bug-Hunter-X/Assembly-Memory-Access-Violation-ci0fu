This repository contains an example of a common assembly language error: a memory access violation caused by incorrect array indexing. The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with added bounds checking.  The issue arises from a lack of bounds checking before accessing memory. This is a crucial aspect of safe memory management in low-level programming languages like assembly.  Understanding and mitigating such errors is vital for developing robust and secure assembly programs.
